# Installation
## Motherboard
The motherboard should be capable of OC (Overclocking)

## Processor
Need more patience other say boi boi to your Processor.
Apply the thermal paste

## RAM
Always use the second slot if we have more RAM slots than we will install.
It is always better to use splitted RAM to utilize the RAM slot(s)

## Graphics Card
The Graphics Card should be capable of OC (Overclocking)




# After PC Build
> Make sure all the plugs are connected and well after building before turning on the power.

>Don't overclock before installing OS; you must do so after in BIOS settings(XMP-Extreme Memory Profile)

1. Install OS
2. Install graphics driver for particular graphics card
3. Install the chipset driver for the particular ship
4. Install any or all Benchmark software(s)
5. Install overclocking or performance boost software provided by the motherboard and GPU
6. Update BIOS if needed (need to be more cautious)
