# Components for our PC
## 4 Components should never be compromised
1. Processor (CPU)
2. Motherboard
3. Graphics Card (if gaming and editing)
4. SMPS (PSU - Power Supply Unit)
## Other components/ tools
5. RAM/Memory
6. SSD/ HDD Storage
7. Cabinet
8. Cooler (if CPU 65watt<)
9. Thermal Paste
10. Screwdrivers
11. Monitor
12. Keyboard and mouse

# Installation

## Processor
- Select wisely according to your needs, such as online editing(Intel since providing more cores), gaming(Ryzen since minimum cores maximum performance), productivity, etc.
- Check that the processor has integrated graphics(if needed)
- Check whether the processor needs an additional cooler or not.
- Need more patience installing the processor to the motherboard otherwise say boi boi to your Processor.
- Apply the correct amount of thermal paste while installing the cooler.

## Motherboard
- Decide the size of the motherboard (Mini-ITX, Micro-ATX, ATX, E-ATX)
- Select by either supports Intel(LGA1151(8th-9th)/LGA1200(10th-11th)/LGA1700(12th-13th)) or AMD Ryzen(am4/am5(7000-9000)) based on processor selection.
  - Intel chip motherboards starts with Z#90(High)/B#60(Mid)/H#10(Low)
  - AMD chip motherboards starts with X#70(High), B#50(Mid), A#20(Low)
- The motherboard should be capable of OC (overclocking), which is better.
- Check for integrated Wi-Fi, which is a must.
- Check for PCLe generation (5th Gen is better).
- Check No. of RAM slots (4 slots better).
- Check No. of SSD/SATA slots.
- The best motherboard brands are ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, ASRock, BIOSTAR, NZXT, etc.
> Not all the motherboards support all the processor's brands and generation/series, be specific.

## RAM
- Check processor details to determine memory type (ddr3/ddr4/ddr5), CAS Latency (CL40/CL36) and memory speed(3200Mhz/5600Mhz/6000Mhz etc)
- Always use the second slot if we have more RAM slots than we will install.
- It is always better to split the RAM sizes to utilize the RAM slot(s)
- The best RAM brands are Corsair (Vengeance), GSKILL(Trident, Ripjaws), Kingston (Fury), Crucial (Ballistix), Samsung, Adata, etc.

## SSD
- The best SSD brands are Crucial, Western Digital Blue, Solidigm, Corsair, ADATA, Samsung, Kingston, Seagate, etc.

## Graphics Card
- The Graphics Card should be capable of OC (Overclocking)
- Best Graphics card brands like Asus, MSI, Sapphire (best for AMD)
- [Slash Gear Ranks](https://www.slashgear.com/1304633/major-graphics-card-brands-ranked/)
- Gigabyte is not having good reviews when comes to graphics card.

## Cabinet
- Decide cabinet size based on motherboard form factor (ATX, mATX, ITX)
- Check the cabinet support length of the Graphics card.
- Check the cabinet support height of the CPU cooler fan (air-cooler) or length of the CPU cooler fan (liquid-cooler)
- Check the cabinet support PSU we have selected
- Check cabinet needs extra fans sized 92mm/120mm/140mm
  
> ATX is supported for all types of motherboard

## Cooling
- Water cooling is better for gaming even if it's costly but efficient
- Air-cooling fan is enough for productivity and the CPU power is less than 65 watts since it is low cost.

## PSU 
Select at least a gold-grade PSU.
- 80 Plus White
- 80 Plus Bronze
- 80 Plus Silver
- 80 Plus Gold
- 80 Plus Platinum
- 80 Plus Titanium


# After PC Build
> Make sure all the plugs are connected well after building and before turning on the power.

> Don't overclock before installing OS; you must do so after in BIOS settings(XMP-Extreme Memory Profile)

1. Install OS
2. Install graphics driver for particular graphics card
3. Install the chipset driver for the particular ship
4. Install any or all Benchmark software(s)
5. Install overclocking or performance boost software provided by the motherboard and GPU
6. Update BIOS if needed (need to be more cautious)
