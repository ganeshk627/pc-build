# Components for our PC
## 4 Components should never be compromised
1. Motherboard
2. Processor (CPU)
3. Graphics Card (if gaming and editing)
4. SMPS (PSU - Power Supply Unit)
## Other components
5. RAM/Memory
6. SSD/ HDD Storage
7. Cabinet
8. Cooler (if CPU 65watt<)
9. Thermal Paste
10. Screwdrivers
11. Monitor
12. Keyboard and mouse

# Installation

## Processor
- Check whether the processor needs an additional cooler or not.
- Check that the processor has integrated graphics(if needed)
- Need more patience installing it otherwise say boi boi to your Processor.
- Apply the thermal paste.

## Motherboard
- Supports Intel(LGA1151(8th-9th)/LGA1200(10th-11th)/LGA1700(12th-13th)) or AMD Ryzen(am4/am5) based on processor selection
- Intel chip motherboards starts with Z#90(High)/B#60(Mid)/H#10(Low)
- AMD chip motherboards starts with X#70(High), B#50(Mid), A#20(Low)
- The motherboard should be capable of OC (Overclocking)
- Check for Wifi integrated
- Check for PCLe generation (5th Gen is better)
- Check No. of RAM slots (4 slots better)
- Check No. of SSD/SATA slots
- Best motherboard brands are ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, ASRock, BIOSTAR, NZXT, etc.

## RAM
- Check processor details to determine memory type (ddr3/ddr4/ddr5) and memory speed(3200Mhz/5200Mhz etc)
- Always use the second slot if we have more RAM slots than we will install.
- It is always better to split the RAM sizes to utilize the RAM slot(s)
- Best RAM brands are Corsair(Vengeance), GSKILL(Trident, Ripjaws), Kingston (Fury), Crucial (Ballistix), Samsung, Adata, etc.

## Graphics Card
- The Graphics Card should be capable of OC (Overclocking)

## Cabinet
- Decide cabinet based on motherboard type (ATX, mATX, ITX)
- Check cabinet needs extra fans sized 92mm/120mm/140mm
> ATX is supported for all types of motherboard

## Cooling
- Water cooling is better for gaming even if it's costly but efficient
- Air-cooling fan is enough for productivity and the CPU power is less than 65 watts since it is low cost.

## PSU 
Select at least gold grade PSU.
- 80 Plus White
- 80 Plus Bronze
- 80 Plus Silver
- 80 Plus Gold
- 80 Plus Platinum
- 80 Plus Titanium


# After PC Build
> Make sure all the plugs are connected well after building and before turning on the power.

> Don't overclock before installing OS; you must do so after in BIOS settings(XMP-Extreme Memory Profile)

1. Install OS
2. Install graphics driver for particular graphics card
3. Install the chipset driver for the particular ship
4. Install any or all Benchmark software(s)
5. Install overclocking or performance boost software provided by the motherboard and GPU
6. Update BIOS if needed (need to be more cautious)
